                                A Person of Peace is:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Someone who is OPEN to hearing Your Story, God's Story, and the Good News of Jesus.</li>
                                    <li>Someone who is HOSPITABLE and WELCOMES you into their home or their workplace or to join events with family and friends.</li>
                                    <li>Someone who KNOWS OTHERS (or is KNOWN BY OTHERS) and who is excited to draw together a small group or even a crowd.</li>
                                    <li>Someone who is FAITHFUL and SHARES what they learn with others - even after you're gone.</li>
                                </ul>
                                A Person of Peace can help rapidly reproduce disciple-making even in a place where followers of Jesus are few and far between. When you want to make disciples in a place where not many - or maybe even any - exist, then looking for a Person of Peace might be the most important thing you do.
