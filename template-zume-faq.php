Culturally in the USA there is a tendency for people to view videos for entertainment or curiosity. That results in videos being viewed out of context. In this case, there is a strong desire for the training to be done in groups, with intent for application, and with accountability. We also want to track where gaps in implementation exist geographically and need the web-based approach to do that. Americans are notoriously bad at reporting and we want to ensure there really is no place left where multiplying disciples are not being made in the USA. Therefore we are choosing, at least for the present, to make it inconvenient and difficult to consume the videos in other than this intended manner.
