                        <p>Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33 Jesus is quoted as saying, "The Kingdom of
                            Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it
                            was all leavened." This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can
                            have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower
                            ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood.</p>
                        <p>The initial goal of Zúme is for there to be a training group of four to twelve people in
                            each census tract in the country. Each of these training groups will start two
                            first-generation churches which will then begin to reproduce. There are about 75,000
                            census tracts in the U.S.</p>
