In addition, we find that once a person is trained with Zúme, they can very easily turn around and launch their own group and facilitate training for others using Zúme. This is a powerful opportunity for multiplying disciple-making principles."

Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood."
msgstr "Zúme是希腊文﹐意思是酵母﹐在马太福音十三章 33 节里﹐耶稣说︰「天国好像面酵﹐有妇人拿来﹐藏在三斗面里﹐直等全团都发起来。」这里比喻天国就像面酵，普普通通的凡夫俗子﹐只用无甚了得普普通通的资源﹐却能为神的国造成无比非凡的影响。这就是「天国酵母」Zúme的目标：装备一般信徒﹐在这个世代成为「天国酵母」﹐让主的门徒生生不息，充满世界，神的国度降临万邦。"

It is simply creating an awareness that a practice or a tool exists and giving a general idea of what it looks like. Modeling repeatedly is not an effective way to equip someone.

The mentor needs to be directive and take an active role in coaching the learner. This phase does not last until the learner is fully competent, but merely until they understand the basics of the skill. If this phase is continued too long, then the learner will develop a dependence on the mentor and never advance to full competence. The end of the assist phase should be marked by the learner starting to model for others.

It may be ten times or more as long as the first two phases combined. As the learner progresses in skill, the contact with the mentor may become less regular and more ad hoc . In this phase the learner gradually takes more responsibility and initiative in the performance of the skill. Typically in disciplemaking the mark of the end of this phase is when the learner has passed on the skill successfully to the fourth generation through those whom he or she is coaching. When a parent is observing a child ride a bicycle and ensuring they have adequate skills and knowledge to ride unsupervised, this is the WATCH phase."
