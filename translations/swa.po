Unfortunately, due to limitations of access, awareness, availability, scheduling, and many other reasons, many people who can and should have access to live training events don’t have access. Zúme is an attempt to provide a high-quality entry level substitute for such people. It uses the same principles as many of the live training types available from others. In addition, we find that once a person is trained with Zúme, they can very easily turn around and launch their own group and facilitate training for others using Zúme. This is a powerful opportunity for multiplying disciple-making principles."

Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood."
msgstr "Zumw inamaanisha kwa lugha ya Kigiriki.Kaktika Mathayo 13:33 Yesu ananukulia akisema “Akawaambia mfano mwingine: “Ufalme wa mbinguni unafanana na chachu ambayo mwanamke aliichukua akaichanganya katika vipimo vitatu vya unga mpaka wote ukaumuka.” Mfano huu unaonyesha jinsi watu wa kawaida,hutumia rasilimali ya kawaida,wanaweza kuwana matokeo zaidi ya kawaida katika ufalme wa Mungu.Zume inanuia kuwapa nguvu na vifaa waumini wa kawaida kuwafikia kila jirani."

#: template-zume-faq.php:148

If the trainees come out of a particular church or denomination or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in developing Zúme come from such networks so we can help arrange that if desired."
