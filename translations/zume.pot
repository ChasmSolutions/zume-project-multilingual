"or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be "
"connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If "
"desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A "
"third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already "
"existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in "
