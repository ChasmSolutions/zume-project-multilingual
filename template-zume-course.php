                    Find the "S.O.A.P.S. Bible Reading" section in your ZÃºme Guidebook and listen to the audio overview.

                    Jesus radically reversed our understanding of leadership by teaching us that if we feel called to
                    lead, then we are being called to serve. A Leadership Cell is a way someone who feels called to lead
                    can develop their leadership by practicing serving.

                            His work to look ahead, see a better tomorrow, make a plan for how to get there, and then
                            prepare the resources we'll need on the way.

                            A 3-Month Plan is a tool you can use to help focus your attention and efforts and keep them

                    Take turns sharing your 3-Month Plans with each other. Take time to ask questions about things you
                    might not understand about plans and how the others will meet their commitments. Ask them to do the
                    same for you and your plan.

                    Find a training partner(s) that is willing to check in with you to report on progress and challenges
                    and ask questions after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks. Commit to doing the same for them.

                    Discuss and decide whether these new Groups will be connected to an existing local church or network

                                    You can put what you know to work by helping spread the word about ZÃºme Training and
                                    inviting others to go through training, too. We make it easy to invite friends
                                    through
                                    email, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and other social sites, but we can't invite your
                                    friends for you.

                                    One of the ways you can put what you know to work is by becoming a county
                                    coordinator,
                                    that is someone who can help connect groups as they get started in your area. If
                                    youâre
                                    the kind of person who likes to help people go and grow, this might be a way God can
                                    use
                                    your gifts to do even more. Let us know by sending an e-mail to

                                    As ZÃºme Training grows, sessions will soon be available in 34 more languages. As we
                                    bring
                                    those trainings online, weâll send you information on people in your neighborhood

                                    speak those languages, so you can share something thatâs built just for them. You
                                    can
