                                    If we want to make disciples who multiply – spiritual producers and not just consumers – then we need to learn and share four main ways God makes everyday followers more like Jesus:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Prayer</li>
                                    <li>Scripture</li>
                                    <li>Body Life</li>
                                    <li>Persecution and Suffering</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2>Watch the Concept Video</h2>
                                <!-- 18 -->
                                <div class="widescreen responsive-embed">
                                    <iframe style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/247063338" width="560" height="315" frameborder="1" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
                                    </iframe>

                                In this video, we’ll talk about how we can help a follower of Jesus become a PRODUCER in
                                God’s kingdom instead of simply a CONSUMER.
                                In His perfect plan, God created us to live in balance - to PRODUCE and to CONSUME, to
                                CREATE and to USE UP, to POUR OUT and to be FILLED so we can POUR OUT again.
                                But, in our broken world, people have rejected God’s plan, and many spend their energy living out
                                just part of God’s perfect equation.
                                They LEARN but they don’t share. They are are FILLED UP but they never pour out. They
                                CONSUME but they don’t produce.<br><br>
                                If we’re going to make disciples who multiply, then we need to share with them how they can be
                                producers and not just consumers.<br><br>
                                <strong>Scripture</strong><br><br>
                                Here’s how — God uses His Written Word - which we call Scripture or The Bible - to grow us
                                spiritually.
                                Every disciple needs to be equipped to learn, interpret and apply Scripture.
                                Over thousands of years and through many different authors, God spoke His word into the hearts
                                of faithful men who captured and shared what they heard.<br><br>
                                The Scriptures teach us God’s story, His plans, His heart, His ways.<br><br>
                                In an earlier session, you learned two simple tools - SOAPS Bible Study and Accountability
                                Groups. In an upcoming session, you’ll learn one more simple tool - 3/3rds Groups.
                                These three tools work together to help equip new followers to learn, interpret and apply God’s
                                Written Word.<br><br>
                                They will learn not to be just hearers of God’s word but doers and sharers, also.
                                God also uses His Spoken Word - which we can discern through Prayer - to grow us spiritually.<br><br>
                                <strong>Prayer</strong><br><br>
                                Prayer is speaking and listening to God. Prayer helps us know God more intimately and
                                understand His heart, His will and His ways.<br><br>
                                Prayer helps us minister and serve others, helps us teach and share in specific ways that helps
                                individuals or a group know God better.<br><br>
                                Two simple tools - Prayer Walking and The Prayer Cycle help followers develop a personal prayer
                                life and learn to pray in ways that serve others.<br><br>
                                These tools help develop a habit of praying without ceasing and learning to see the world from a
                                spiritual perspective instead of only relying on what we can visibly see.<br><br>
                                When used consistently, they help a follower of Jesus, increase their capacity for prayer and
                                enhance their ability to hear from God and share what they hear.<br><br>
                                <strong>Body</strong><br><br>
                                God uses His Body of Believers - which we call The Church or the Followers of Jesus - to grow us
                                spiritually.<br><br>
                                As the gathering of believers, we are connected. God’s Word says that in Jesus - we are many
                                parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. In other words, we’re not just connected to
                                God - we’re connected with each other.<br><br>
                                God says to submit to one another. God says to serve one another.<br><br>
                                Each of us has different strengths and each has weaknesses. God expects us to use our
                                strengths to help others who may be weak. And He expects us to allow others to help us in our
                                weakness using the strengths He has given them.<br><br>
                                God’s Word says God has given each of you some special abilities; be sure to use them to help
                                each other, passing on to others God’s many kinds of blessings.<br><br>
                                Simple tools like 3/3rds Groups, Accountability Groups and Peer Mentoring help us encourage
                                one another to love and good works by not only helping us to obey what God tells us to do but
                                also helping us find ways to share what we learn with others.<br><br>
                                <strong>Suffering</strong><br><br>
                                God also uses Persecution and Suffering - sacrifice and loss that we suffer on behalf of Jesus - to
                                grow us spiritually.<br><br>
                                When people oppress and hurt us because we love and obey Jesus, or when bad things happen
                                even though we love and obey Jesus, God uses those persecutions and sufferings to refine our
                                character and make us more like Jesus.<br><br>
                                He develops our character, strengthens and purifies our faith, equips for ministry and allows us to
                                serve others who are suffering in a special way - all while making Himself known more clearly to
                                everyone who watches us and knows our pain.<br><br>
                                God tells us that as followers of Jesus we should expect to be persecuted.
                                Jesus said - God will bless you when people insult you, mistreat you, and tell all kinds of evil lies
                                about you because of me. Be happy and excited! You will have a great reward in heaven. People
                                did these same things to the prophets who lived long ago.<br><br>
                                Simple tools like 3/3rds Groups and Accountability Groups give followers of Jesus an opportunity
                                to share the persecutions and sufferings they experience.<br><br>
                                These groups give you a chance to teach disciples that God’s word says we should expect hard
                                times and to equip them in how to respond well by trusting God’s love even when things go
                                wrong.<br><br>
                                Scripture. Prayer. Body Life. Persecution and Suffering.<br><br>
                                These are all ways that God grows us to be more like His perfect Son, Jesus.
                                Simple tools help us not to just be consumers of these good things that God has given us but to
                                be producers and sharers as well.<br><br>
